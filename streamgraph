using d3.js streamgraph...

x series:
latitude of survey unit
thickness of band would be different duck species
thickness of band would be how many of that latitude
different shades would be different ducks

roughly 16 species
bunch of dabbling ducks... all shades of green
bunch of diving ducks... all different of blue
tundra swans... white
sea ducks... dark shades (black to gray)
merganser ducks... orange to red

slider at bottom to move through years
also... a run button to move through years

from the shape file how to extract a number

issues: smaller survey units vs larger survey units
some overlap
some latitudes don't have as many survey units as others
candlesticks?

also: noncontiguous cartogram
